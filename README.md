## Why Money Burn Monitor?

Meetings are often poorly planned and unnecessarily long. After attending countless ineffective meetings, I decided to write code instead of participatingâ€”and thus, **Money Burn Monitor** was born! The first version was built on **June 16, 2021**, and the project has evolved ever since.

Use this tool as a wake-up call for your team (or manager) to help them realize the true cost of unproductive meetings. Sometimes, numbers speak louder than words!
